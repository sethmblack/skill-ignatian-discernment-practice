# Ignatian Discernment Practice

A structured spiritual approach to decision-making based on the 500-year Jesuit tradition of discernment, attending to interior movements of consolation and desolation to find God's will in concrete choices.

---

## When to Use

- Facing a significant life decision (career, relationship, vocation)
- Confusion about direction or purpose
- Multiple good options with no clear choice
- User asks "What should I do?" or "How do I discern?"
- Need to distinguish genuine calling from fear or desire
- Seeking alignment between values and action

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| decision | Yes | The choice or question being discerned |
| options | No | Specific alternatives being considered |
| context | No | Life situation, values, constraints |
| timeline | No | When decision needs to be made |

## Core Concepts

### Consolation and Desolation

The heart of Ignatian discernment is attention to interior movements:

**Consolation** - Experiences that draw us toward God, authentic self, and loving action:
- Increase of faith, hope, love
- Interior peace and joy
- Sense of rightness and alignment
- Energy for service and growth
- Feeling drawn toward life

**Desolation** - Experiences that pull us away from God and our true path:
- Darkness, confusion, agitation
- Loss of hope, faith, or love
- Turning inward in unhealthy ways
- Resistance to growth
- Feeling pulled toward isolation or despair

**Key Principle:** Never make important decisions during desolation. Desolation is not God speaking; it is a time to persist in prior commitments and wait for clarity.

### The Daily Examen

A five-step daily practice for growing in discernment awareness:

1. **Gratitude** - Recall the day's gifts
2. **Petition** - Ask for light to see clearly
3. **Review** - Walk through the day noticing consolation and desolation
4. **Response** - Acknowledge failings, celebrate graces
5. **Resolve** - Look forward with hope

### Finding God in All Things

Ignatian spirituality insists God is present and active in every dimension of life - not only in "religious" moments. Discernment means attending to where God is already at work.

### Testing the Spirits

Not every good feeling is consolation from God; not every difficulty is desolation. The "spirits" must be tested:
- Does this lead toward greater love of God and neighbor?
- Does this bear fruit in peace, patience, kindness?
- Does this align with my deepest values and commitments?
- Would I be proud of this choice in 10 years?

## The Discernment Framework

### Step 1: Create Interior Freedom

Before discerning, cultivate "indifference" - not apathy, but freedom from disordered attachments that would bias the decision.

Ask: Am I free enough to choose either option if that is where God leads? Or am I secretly determined on one path regardless of what discernment reveals?

### Step 2: Gather Information

Discernment is not opposed to reason. Gather relevant facts:
- What are the realistic options?
- What are the likely consequences of each?
- What do trusted advisors say?
- What do my skills, circumstances, and responsibilities suggest?

### Step 3: Attend to Consolation and Desolation

With each option in mind, notice:
- When I imagine choosing this path, what do I experience?
- Is there peace, energy, rightness? (consolation)
- Is there agitation, darkness, constriction? (desolation)
- Over time, which option consistently produces consolation?

**Important:** Initial feelings may be misleading. Sustained attention over days or weeks reveals deeper movements.

### Step 4: Test the Spirits

Apply criteria to the consolation/desolation:
- Is this leading toward love, service, growth?
- Is this consistent with my deepest commitments?
- Does this feel like authentic desire or fear/avoidance?
- How would I advise a friend facing this choice?

### Step 5: Make the Decision and Seek Confirmation

Choose the path that, over time, consistently produces authentic consolation and leads toward love.

Then notice: Does peace and rightness persist after deciding? Ongoing consolation confirms the choice. Persistent desolation suggests reconsideration.

## Discernment Report

### The Question
[Clear statement of what is being discerned]

### Interior Freedom Check
**Current attachments:** [What might bias the discernment?]
**Freedom status:** [Ready to discern / Needs more preparation]

### Information Gathered
[Relevant facts, options, consequences, counsel]

### Consolation/Desolation Observations

**Option A:**
- Consolation signs: [What draws toward life, love, peace?]
- Desolation signs: [What produces darkness, agitation?]

**Option B:**
- Consolation signs: [What draws toward life, love, peace?]
- Desolation signs: [What produces darkness, agitation?]

### Testing the Spirits
[Does the consolation lead toward authentic love and growth?]
[Is this consistent with deepest values and commitments?]

### Provisional Discernment
**Direction suggested:** [Which path?]
**Confidence level:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Next step:** [What would confirm or challenge this?]

### The Examen Invitation
[Invitation to daily practice of attention]

## Constraints

- Discernment is not a magic formula guaranteeing correct answers
- This is a spiritual practice, not just a decision-making technique
- Never rush discernment of significant decisions
- Discernment assumes basic psychological health; trauma or mental illness may require professional support first
- The framework illuminates; the person must still choose
- Some decisions have no clear "right" answer - both paths may be good
- Honor the person's religious/spiritual context

## Example

**Input:** "I've been offered a promotion that would mean more money and prestige, but much more travel and stress. My current role is comfortable but feels stagnant. I don't know what to do."

**Output:**

## Discernment Report

### The Question
Should I accept the promotion (more money, prestige, travel, stress) or remain in my current role (comfort, stability, sense of stagnation)?

### Interior Freedom Check
**Current attachments:**
- Fear of failure in the new role (might bias toward staying)
- Attraction to status and money (might bias toward accepting)
- Comfort seeking (might bias toward staying)
- Restlessness (might bias toward change for its own sake)

**Freedom status:** Partially ready. Acknowledge these pulls without letting them determine the choice. The question is: What is God inviting, not what do I want or fear?

### Information Gathered
- Promotion offers: higher salary, greater influence, increased responsibility
- Cost: significantly more travel, higher stress, less family time
- Current role: stable, manageable, but no longer challenging
- Your stated values include: family, meaningful work, service, growth
- Timeline: Decision needed within 2 weeks

### Consolation/Desolation Observations

**Taking the Promotion:**
- Consolation signs: Energy when imagining new challenges; sense of using gifts more fully; excitement about influence
- Desolation signs: Anxiety about travel burden; constriction when imagining time away from family; a feeling of "having to prove something" rather than genuine calling

**Staying in Current Role:**
- Consolation signs: Peace about work-life balance; gratitude for stability; freedom from proving self
- Desolation signs: Sense of stagnation and unfulfilled potential; boredom that leads to restlessness; fear of missing opportunity

### Testing the Spirits

The consolation around the promotion seems mixed - genuine energy alongside ego-driven proving. The desolation about staying feels like authentic restlessness, not mere fear.

Key question: Is the restlessness in your current role about genuine growth-seeking or escape from inner work?

The family-time concern with the promotion feels like authentic values speaking, not mere comfort-seeking.

**What would love look like here?** Love for family suggests caution about dramatic travel increase. Love for self suggests addressing stagnation rather than accepting it.

### Provisional Discernment

**Direction suggested:** The binary may be false. The discernment suggests:
1. The stagnation is real and deserves response
2. This particular promotion may not be the right response (the stress/travel cost seems to produce more desolation than the opportunity produces consolation)
3. A third path may exist: growth within current organization, or different opportunity that addresses stagnation without the specific costs of this promotion

**Confidence level:** Medium - more time and prayer would help

**Next step:**
- Can you negotiate different terms (less travel)?
- Are there other growth opportunities you haven't explored?
- Spend a week with the Examen, attending specifically to this question

### The Examen Invitation

For the next week, end each day with five minutes of attention:
1. Where today did you feel most alive, most yourself, most drawn toward love?
2. Where today did you feel constricted, anxious, pulled away from your values?
3. How do these daily movements relate to the decision before you?

Notice patterns. Discernment is not a single moment but an ongoing conversation. God speaks not once but continuously - your work is to develop ears to hear.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Pope Francis** expert persona and draws on the Ignatian tradition that formed his spiritual life. Use it when people face significant decisions and need a framework for attending to more than just pros and cons - to the deeper movements of the heart where God speaks.
